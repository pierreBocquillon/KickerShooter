# KickerShooter

KickerShooter is a top down shooter game with a neon retro minimalist look in which you should work your way through 5 levels.

Unfortunately for you, waves of increasingly complex enemies will come to block your way. You will have to clean up each enemy present before you can access the next level.

To do this you will have access to a varied arsenal of weapons of all kinds, each with its advantages and disadvantages.

Will you be a tank that destroys everything in its path or a strategist that saves every single ammunition?

Good luck and have fun !
